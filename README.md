```bash
python app.py
```

#### 2. Open in Browser

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

#### 3. Upload & Analyze

* Drag and drop your support dump `.zip` file onto the page, or click to select it.
* Choose the minimum log level you want to analyze.
* Click **Analyze**.
* The report will be generated and displayed directly in your browser.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

For advanced users or automation, the original CLI is still available.
