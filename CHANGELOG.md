## [2.0.0] - In Development

### Added
- **Flask Web Interface**: Implemented a web application (`app.py`) for a user-friendly experience.
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: The web UI features a styled upload area that supports drag-and-drop for `.zip` files and provides immediate user feedback.
- **In-Browser Reporting**: The analysis is now run on the backend, and the final HTML report is rendered directly in the browser, removing the need to handle local files.
- **Security Enhancements**: Added `secure_filename` to sanitize uploads and a `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` to limit file size.

### Changed
- **`reporter.py`**: The `generate_report` function was refactored to return HTML content as a string instead of writing to a file, enabling in-browser rendering.
- **Dependencies**: Added `Flask` to `requirements.txt`.
